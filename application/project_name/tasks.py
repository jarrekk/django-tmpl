Example:
crontab()   Execute every minute.
crontab(minute=0, hour=0)   Execute daily at midnight.
crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3')   Execute every three hours: midnight, 3am, 6am, 9am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm.
crontab(minute=0, hour='0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21')   Same as previous.
crontab(minute='*/15')  Execute every 15 minutes.
crontab(day_of_week='sunday')   Execute every minute (!) at Sundays.
crontab(minute='*', hour='*', day_of_week='sun')    Same as previous.
crontab(minute='*/10', hour='3,17,22', day_of_week='thu,fri')   Execute every ten minutes, but only between 3-4 am, 5-6 pm, and 10-11 pm on Thursdays or Fridays.
crontab(minute=0, hour='*/2,*/3')   Execute every even hour, and every hour divisible by three. This means: at every hour except: 1am, 5am, 7am, 11am, 1pm, 5pm, 7pm, 11pm
crontab(minute=0, hour='*/5')   Execute hour divisible by 5. This means that it is triggered at 3pm, not 5pm (since 3pm equals the 24-hour clock value of “15”, which is divisible by 5).
crontab(minute=0, hour='*/3,8-17')  Execute every hour divisible by 3, and every hour during office hours (8am-5pm).
crontab(0, 0, day_of_month='2') Execute on the second day of every month.
crontab(0, 0, day_of_month='2-30/3')    Execute on every even numbered day.
crontab(0, 0, day_of_month='1-7,15-21') Execute on the first and third weeks of the month.
crontab(0, 0, day_of_month='11', month_of_year='5') Execute on the eleventh of May every year.
crontab(0, 0, month_of_year='*/3')  Execute on the first month of every quarter.
